# Audio Recording & Playback Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Record Button Not Starting Recording
**Problem**: The BLE connection was automatically capturing audio data as soon as connected, regardless of the record button state.

**Solution**: 
- Added `isRecordingRef` to track recording state properly
- Modified audio data handler to only capture audio when `isRecordingRef.current` is true
- Fixed the recording state management to properly start/stop audio capture

### 2. Playback Not Working
**Problem**: Audio context handling and playback logic had several issues.

**Solution**:
- Improved audio context creation and management
- Added proper audio context suspension/resumption handling
- Fixed audio source cleanup and error handling
- Added better error messages for debugging

### 3. Real-Time Audio Streaming Issues
**Problem**: The firmware streams audio continuously (160 samples every 10ms), but the React app wasn't handling this properly.

**Solution**:
- Fixed audio data handling to work with continuous BLE stream
- Added real-time packet counting and stream status indicators
- Updated transcription to work with live audio stream
- Added proper stream monitoring and debugging information

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Start the React App
```bash
cd /Users/armeshpereira/Documents/LastAttempt/reactapp
npm start
```

### 2. Test Recording Flow
1. **Connect to XIAO Board**: Click "Connect to XIAO Board" button
2. **Verify Connection**: Status should show "Connected"
3. **Start Recording**: Click "Start Recording" button
   - Timer should start counting
   - Status should show "Recording from XIAO Board..."
   - Console should show "Started recording..."
4. **Speak into XIAO**: Make some noise/speech into the XIAO microphone
5. **Stop Recording**: Click "Stop Recording" button
   - Timer should stop
   - Status should show "Recording Complete"
   - Console should show captured samples count

### 3. Test Playback Flow
1. **After Recording**: Play button should appear
2. **Click Play**: Audio should start playing through browser speakers
3. **Verify Playback**: Status should show "Playing Recording"
4. **Click Pause**: Audio should stop, status should update

### 4. Test Download
1. **Click Download**: Should download a WAV file
2. **Verify File**: File should be playable in audio players

## Key Changes Made

### AudioRecorder.js
- Added `isRecordingRef` for proper recording state tracking
- Fixed audio data capture to only happen during recording
- Improved playback with proper audio context management
- Added better error handling and user feedback

### BLEConnection.js
- Simplified audio data flow
- Removed automatic processing of audio data
- Let AudioRecorder component control when to capture audio

## Expected Behavior
- **Before Fix**: Audio was captured immediately on connection
- **After Fix**: Audio is only captured when record button is pressed
- **Before Fix**: Playback often failed or had issues
- **After Fix**: Playback should work reliably with proper audio context handling

## Debug Information
Check browser console for:
- "Started recording..." when record button is pressed
- "Captured X samples, total: Y" during recording
- "Recording stopped. Captured X samples" when stopped
- "Playback started" when play button is pressed
- Any error messages if issues occur

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify XIAO board is properly connected and streaming audio
3. Ensure browser has microphone permissions
4. Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
